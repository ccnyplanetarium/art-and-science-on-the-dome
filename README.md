# art-and-science-on-the-dome

This collection contains some various examples of dome ready science-art for use in planetariums.

## Processing

Processing is a great way to do some creative coding and then map it the dome. See the folder `processing-sketches` for some examples. These are inspired and adopted from the [Nature of Code - Cosmos Edition](https://github.com/nature-of-code/The-Nature-of-Code-Cosmos-Edition/tree/master/dome/fisheye_shader).

## P5

The javascript library P5.js can also be used be used to make dome visualizations. 

Here's a fun one: The Magic Flute 1815 stage set turned into a fulldome fisheye view.
